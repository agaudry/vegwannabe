# habbit_count
a simple accountability app


NEXT STEP
simple start/stop task button

1st route creates "do" entry in db with end_at at None

2nd route takes either no argument (input time will be calculated), 0 in which case the entry will be deleted, an int in which case time will be counted in minutes


****** TO DO
Need to figure out relationships between tables, to deal with conditional style

- Service worker to support offline requests
